# Changes to PostCSS Tape

### 5.0.2 (July 29, 2019)

- Fixed: Issue loading a test plugin

### 5.0.1 (July 29, 2019)

- Fixed: Tests for an error
- Fixed: Documentation errors

### 5.0.0 (May 16, 2019)

- Updated: Node 8+ compatibility (major)
- Fixed: Better support warnings and errors

### 4.0.0 (December 22, 2018)

- Changes the nested `postcss-plugin: { "test-name": {} }` with
`{ "test-name": {} }`.
- Supports a `--ci true` mode for full logging

I’ve rewritten the plugin in less lines of code and hopefully more clearly.
I had a lot of trouble following the old version, so it’s very hard to know
what changes there are. I also accidentally published an incompatible version,
so version 3 is skipped for 4.
