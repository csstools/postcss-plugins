# Hard fork of postcss-values-parser

⚠️ Do not use this directly. ⚠️

see : https://github.com/shellscape/postcss-values-parser

`postcss-values-parser` has issues when multiple packages have different versions or if npm does not dedupe the packages correctly.

This package is intended solely for `@csstools/postcss-plugins`
There is no promise of API stability and support.

This package might be abandoned tomorrow if we find a better solution.
