# Stylelint plugins

This is limited to Stylelint plugins that support our PostCSS plugins.

Good candidates :
- a plugin to migrate from an old version of a PostCSS plugin to a new one.
- a plugin to warn on syntax that can not be transformed for older browsers.
- ...

Bad candidates :
- a plugin to enforce a code formatting preference.
- a plugin to enforce usage of a specific feature.
