## Our current focus

### Standard CSS transforms

We're trying to bring every reasonable CSS Spec into all the browsers. 

First we keep track of new features through the [CSSDB] (see the [repo][CSSDB Repo]). Then we do our best to create a [PostCSS] plugin that can convert that new syntax/function/rules so every browser can understand it. 

While it's not always possible we're enabling over 50 features with these plugins!

### Developer experience

We want it to be easier for you to be effective at writing CSS.  
From time to time we will publish plugins that aren't related to a standard CSS spec but that we think will help developers.
