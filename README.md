We are happy you're here!

This repository uses a monorepo architecture that contains plugins, plugin-packs and CLI tools to help you transform your CSS so every browser can understand it.

Our wish is that you can leverage the CSS that will become a standard with every browser!

## A brief look into the structure

This repository leverages [NPM Workspaces] to handle every package/project. 

[PostCSS Plugins] contains tools and plugins for [PostCSS Preset Env].

[PostCSS Preset Env] lets you convert modern CSS into something most browsers
can understand, determining the polyfills you need based on your targeted
browsers or runtime environments.

There's also a [CLI] that allows you to quickly debug or prototype without having to configure PostCSS before you need any toolchain.

Under [sites] you can find websites that we publish to better display all of this information.

## Our current focus

We're trying to bring every reasonable CSS Spec into all the browsers. 

First we keep track of new features through the [CSSDB] (see the [repo][CSSDB Repo]). Then we do our best to create a [PostCSS] plugin that can convert that new syntax/function/rules so every browser can understand it. 

While it's not always possible we're enabling over 30 features with these plugins!

You can keep track of our current efforts on the [PostCSS Preset Env Project] and also read announcements on the [project's discussions][discussions].
