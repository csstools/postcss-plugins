[<humanReadableName>] is a very basic CSS minifier.

It guarantees two things :
- browsers can not tell the difference between the original and the minified CSS
- lawyers can not tell the difference between the original and the minified CSS

Compared to other minifiers, [<humanReadableName>] is purely focused on correctness and fidelity.  
[<humanReadableName>] only collapses whitespace and comments while preserving those comments that are important for legal compliance.

[<humanReadableName>] is not a CSS optimizer, it does not try to reduce the size of the CSS file by altering the CSS itself.

```css
<example.css>
```

becomes :

```css
<example.expect.css>
```
