// unless the condition is true or unless the conditional group rule can evaluate differently for different elements in the document.
//
// Since the layer order is global to the document,
// any layers defined inside an element-sensitive conditional group rule need to be accommodated
// when establishing the global layer order, regardless of the ruleâ€™s condition.
// Conditions that are global to the document, however (such as @media and @supports) can accommodate such @layer rules conditionally.
