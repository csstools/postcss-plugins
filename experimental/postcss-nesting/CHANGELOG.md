# Changes to PostCSS Nesting Experimental

### 1.0.0

Implement the 28 October version of [css-nestng-1](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting/)

- relative selector syntax
- `:is()` pseudo is always used to de-sugar nesting
- better support for `@layer`
- remove `@nest`

Known issues :

- selector invalidation works different (needs examples in README)
- no support for `@scope` (needs media query parser)
