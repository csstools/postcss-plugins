# Authoring guidelines

We want to make it easier to write awesome CSS that works great in as many browsers as possible.
Some of these browsers are a bit older, others don't yet exist.

We will not place undue burden on anyone writing or maintaining CSS.

We will only add a plugin to `postcss-preset-env` when the CSS WG invites implementations for the relevant features.

We will not create plugins with features (or add features to plugins) that look and feel native but don't have a specification.

We will make it clear that non-standard, pre-processor features are just that.

We will only implement that which we know is correct and avoid side effects.
